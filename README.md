This is a golang implemintation of a discord chat explorer like [this](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) or [this](https://github.com/mahtoid/DiscordChatExporterPy).

## Features

- Highly configurable 
- Barely any dependencies
- Multiple ways of exporting (TEXT (ie. a log), JSON w/ meta info, HTML (visual))
- Allows auto parsing of channels
- Allows filters that aren't mutually exclusive (unlike discord)
- Golang superiority
- Mass downloads from guild(s)
- Commitments to less bloat
- Customisability 

## Setup

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/ShadiestGoat/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Setup)

## Faq

### Why a user token?

You have to use a user token, since bots are no longer allowed to download messages later than the last 2 weeks. 

### Discord TOS?

This is technically breaking the discord terms of service, as it is user botting. 

However, so far, haven't been banned so make your own conclusions.

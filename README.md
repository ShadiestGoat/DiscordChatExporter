## Faq

### Why a user token?

You have to use a user token, since bots are no longer allowed to download messages later than the last 2 weeks. 

### Discord TOS?

This is technically breaking the discord terms of service, as it is user botting. 

However, so far, haven't been banned so make your own conclusions.
